This fork reverts most of the changes to FavCat, **brings back avatar favorites** and the ability for FavCat to **index public avatars that you see**. 


## FavCat
An all-in-one local favorites mod. Unlimited favorite lists with unlimited favorites in them and a searchable local database of content and players.  
**Requires UI Expansion Kit 0.2.0 or newer**  
#### Features:

* Lag-free even with large lists
* Freely changeable list height
* Avatar, world, and player favorites supported
* Modifiable list order and multiple list sorting options
* Fully searchable database of everything you have ever seen
* Changeable database location (**it's recommended to store the database in a directory backed up to cloud storage, such as Dropbox or OneDrive**, see below for setup)
* Local image cache for even better performance
* Categorize your own private avatars
* Import avatar favorites from other local favorite mods (read below)
* Exchange search database with friends (read below)

* Many more small things

#### Known limitations
* Player favorites don't show online status

#### Changing database location
Steps to change database location:
1. Run VRChat with the mod at least once
2. Make sure that VRChat is closed
3. Navigate to VRChat install directory (i.e. by clicking "Browse Local Files" in Steam)
4. Navigate to `UserData` folder and open `MelonPreferenes.cfg` with Notepad or other text editor
5. Find the line with `[FavCat]`
6. Find the line with `DatabasePath` under it
7. Change the value to absolute path to new storage folder. The new line should look like this: `DatabasePath = "C:/Users/username/OneDrive"` (with your own path, naturally; make sure to use forward clashes `/` instead of backslashes `\\`)
8. Save and close the text file
9. Copy the two (or four) database files (`favcat-favs.db` and `favacat-store.db`, and `favcat-favs-log.db` and `favcat-store-log.db` if they exist) from the old location (they are in `UserData` by default) to the new one.

If you want to move the image cache, use the same steps as above, but modify the line with `ImageCachePath` and copy `favcat-images.db` instead. It's not recommended to store the image cache in cloud storage due to its big size.

#### Sharing search database with friends
You can exchange the search database with friends to be able to find things they have seen. **Only accept databases from friends you trust - an intentionally malformed database can overwrite parts of yours with garbage**  
How to send database to a friend:
1. Run VRChat with the mod at least once (duh)
2. Make sure that VRChat is closed
3. Navigate to where your database is stored (see "Changing database location")
4. Make sure that there is no file named `favcat-store-log.db`. If there is one, it means that the game was not closed properly. In that case, run the game again, and use "Exit VRChat" button in settings menu to close it.
5. Send `favcat-store.db` to your friend.

How to receive database from a friend:
1. Run VRChat with the mod at least once
2. Navigate to VRChat install directory (i.e. by clicking "Browse Local Files" in Steam)
3. Put the database your friend sent you into `UserData/FavCatImport` folder. If you want to import multiple databases at once, you can rename them, as long as .db extension is kept.
4. In-game, click "More FavCat" on any big menu page, then click "Import databases and text files"
5. Import process can take some time. Once it is done, the corresponding database will be deleted from `UserData/FavCatImport` folder.

Note that your favorites are stored in `favcat-favs.db` - don't send it to your friends, favorite import is not supported. Most certainly don't send `favcat-images.db` to your friends - it's just a boring image cache.



#### Used libraries:
* [LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB) for all data storage
* [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp), because unity is bad at loading images from streams on background thread
